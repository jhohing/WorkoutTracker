# WorkoutTracker

## Description

Workout Tracker is an application that uses MongoDB to store a user's workout. It allows the user to input the exercise, the number of sets, the number of reps, and the duration and if it is cardio, it allows the user to input the distance and duration. It will use that data to create stats for the user.

Here is a link to my deployed application: https://mysterious-fjord-13166.herokuapp.com
